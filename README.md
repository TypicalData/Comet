# 🌐Tool that lets you diagnose your network.

Using few libraries and API i created simple TUI controled app that may help you diagnosing your machine...
It lets you check if specyfic ports are open or closed, it can conduct IP lookups and more.

# 🎯Purpose
You are probably wondering... why? Well, first of all, this is fun project and pretty good way to develop skills.
I also wanted to create very simple and lightweight tool that may be usefull for someone.

# 🛠️Setup
1. Make sure you have python installed
```bash
python -V
```
2. Download Comet.py
3. In terminal run following command in order to install required modules - >
```bash
pip install colorama, ipregistry, speedtest-cli
``` 
4. Navigate to the projects folder using ``cd (name of the next folder in path)``
5. In terminal run following command - > 
```bash
python Comet.py
```

If all done correctly you should be able to use this program...

Keep in mind that this is early stage of this project... so far its not very complicated.
